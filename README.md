To uncover the value of the ‘betel-nut’ thus involves exploring both *Areca catechu* which produces the areca nut and *Piper betle* L. which produces the betel leaf, which have been adopted for many uses, including as medicines, dyes, adhesives, and culinary ingredients.[^3] Amongst these vast applications, perhaps the species’ most notable mark in Singapore and Southeast Asia has been in the widespread practice of betel-nut chewing.[^4] The English name for the practice ‘betel-nut chewing’ (hereafter ‘betel chewing’ to refer to the practice and ‘betel-nut’ when referring to the areca nut and betel leaf together) perpetuates the misnomer of the two species’ relationship as it is the areca nut – wrapped inside the betel leaf – that is chewed, typically alongside other ingredients.[^5] As a rich multicultural regional tradition, the scope of betel chewing’s impact surpasses the act itself and is an apt reflection of Singapore’s multicultural history.


## Chewing the Betel-Nut Quid
The simplest form of betel chewing requires three ingredients: the areca nut, a betel leaf, and lime (mineral material).[^6] The areca nut is sliced or cut and shaved and wrapped into the leaf which is topped with slaked lime flakes or lime paste.[^7] The betel quid is then chewed as the tongue presses between the teeth and cheek where the quid is located.[^8] In Indian communities, additional spices such as cardamon, cloves, and nutmeg are often added to the basic betel quid to make *pan/paan*.[^9] The addition of chewing tobacco and gambier were also popular complements to the betel quid in different communities within Singapore and Malaya.[^10] 


## Uncertain Origins and Arrival in Singapore
While betel chewing has over time proliferated across Asia and the Pacific Islands, there is uncertainty regarding the origins of the practice.[^11]  More recent linguistic and archaeological evidence has suggested that the practice is likely indigenous to the Indonesian archipelago, with the earliest archaeological evidence of the species in Spirit Cave in north-western Thailand in 10,000 BC and betel-stained teeth found in the Philippines documented to 3000 BC.[^12] The earliest archaeological evidence for the emergence of the practice in Singapore points to the 1300s, where traces of lime were found in containers that may have been used to prepare the betel-nut quid.[^13] According to botanist Isaac Burkill, the palm is “undoubtedly Malaysian in origin, but [it is] impossible to find any restricted part of Malaysia as its home.”[^14] This ambiguity regarding the roots of the plant, the practice, and its arrival in Singapore highlights the convergence of cultures on a similar practice of chewing that blurs the distinction between where the practice originated, how it evolved, and how it was subsequently influenced.
