To uncover the value of the ‘betel-nut’ thus involves exploring both *Areca catechu* which produces the areca nut and *Piper betle* L. which produces the betel leaf, which have been adopted for many uses, including as medicines, dyes, adhesives, and culinary ingredients.[^3] Amongst these vast applications, perhaps the species’ most notable mark in Singapore and Southeast Asia has been in the widespread practice of betel-nut chewing.[^4] The English name for the practice ‘betel-nut chewing’ (hereafter ‘betel chewing’ to refer to the practice and ‘betel-nut’ when referring to the areca nut and betel leaf together) perpetuates the misnomer of the two species’ relationship as it is the areca nut – wrapped inside the betel leaf – that is chewed, typically alongside other ingredients.[^5] As a rich multicultural regional tradition, the scope of betel chewing’s impact surpasses the act itself and is an apt reflection of Singapore’s multicultural history.


## Chewing the Betel-Nut Quid
The simplest form of betel chewing requires three ingredients: the areca nut, a betel leaf, and lime (mineral material).[^6] The areca nut is sliced or cut and shaved and wrapped into the leaf which is topped with slaked lime flakes or lime paste.[^7] The betel quid is then chewed as the tongue presses between the teeth and cheek where the quid is located.[^8] In Indian communities, additional spices such as cardamon, cloves, and nutmeg are often added to the basic betel quid to make *pan/paan*.[^9] The addition of chewing tobacco and gambier were also popular complements to the betel quid in different communities within Singapore and Malaya.[^10] 


## Uncertain Origins and Arrival in Singapore
While betel chewing has over time proliferated across Asia and the Pacific Islands, there is uncertainty regarding the origins of the practice.[^11]  More recent linguistic and archaeological evidence has suggested that the practice is likely indigenous to the Indonesian archipelago, with the earliest archaeological evidence of the species in Spirit Cave in north-western Thailand in 10,000 BC and betel-stained teeth found in the Philippines documented to 3000 BC.[^12] The earliest archaeological evidence for the emergence of the practice in Singapore points to the 1300s, where traces of lime were found in containers that may have been used to prepare the betel-nut quid.[^13] According to botanist Isaac Burkill, the palm is “undoubtedly Malaysian in origin, but [it is] impossible to find any restricted part of Malaysia as its home.”[^14] This ambiguity regarding the roots of the plant, the practice, and its arrival in Singapore highlights the convergence of cultures on a similar practice of chewing that blurs the distinction between where the practice originated, how it evolved, and how it was subsequently influenced.


## Literary History Highlighting Cultural Traditions
The practice of betel chewing precedes modern history, with mentions in literary traditions spanning cultures. Notably, betel chewing is mentioned in multiple passages in the Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals) where it belonged to the aristocratic realm as a symbol of status and pleasure.[^15] However, by the 1800s in Singapore, betel chewing was a widespread practice among Indian, Malay, and Peranakan communities, with an 1827 newspaper article commenting that the “very spirited demand” had evolved into the practice becoming “quite a drug” in reference to its stimulant and addictive properties.[^16] By the 1950s, arguably at the height of the practice’s prevalence in Singapore, there was wide consensus that betel nuts were far from a luxury good and instead an integral part of daily life that transcended class boundaries.[^17] 

The spread in the practice is attached to the high cultural and symbolic value associated with both betel chewing and the betel leaf. In the Sri Rama (Malay derivation of the Ramayana), betel chewing is a gesture of welcoming and invitation.[^18] This is paired with expressions of humility about the quality of the nut as an additional token of Malay politeness.[^19] The Sri Rama also highlights the physical effects of betel chewing, notably its “stupefying effect” which underscores the chemical properties tied to its medicinal value.[^20]  

In the Malay story of Raja Donan, betel chewing is integral to betrothal procedures as a sign of devotion.[^21] Indeed, alongside the nut itself which is presented to guests during special occasions, the betel container *kotak sirih*, which holds the betel quid ingredients in different compartments, was often gifted in proposal or wedding ceremonies.[^22] Overall, both the betel quid as well as the betel leaf itself came with high symbolic social value and were regarded as tokens of friendliness, agreement, invitation, and even as a formal apology in Malay communities.[^23] 

Betel chewing is similarly significant in Indian cultural and literary traditions. While *pan* originally referred to the betel leaf, it evolved to denote both the areca nut and betel leaf.[^24] The *Hitopadesha* (directly translated as good or friendly advice) is a compilation of Sanskrit fables drawing on *niti* or the principles of morality to advise on proper conduct.[^25] In the story of the faithful Rajpoot, thirteen ‘virtues’ of the areca nut are given, capturing attributes like it being sweet, salty, bitter, and astringent, practical and medicinal properties such as  acting as a mouth freshener, aiding in digestion, relieving inflammation, and inciting desire, as well cultural values tied to love and virtue.[^26]

As Marigowda emphases, “to attempt to write about the ceremonial uses of betel nut and betel leaves in India… may be likened to an attempt to write the cultural history of the people of India in one sentence.”[^27] This is extended further when considering other cultures’ different, though often overlapping, valuation and usage of the betel nut.
