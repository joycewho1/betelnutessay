## Behind the “Betel-nut Palm” Moniker 
The areca palm (*Areca catechu*), also commonly known as the betel-nut palm, pinang palm, areca-nut palm, and betel palm, is a naturalised non-native palm species found in Singapore.[^1]  While the areca palm is known by the moniker ‘betel-nut palm’, this name actually derives from its long association with the vine of the pepper plant *Piper betle* L. which often grows around the areca palm.[^2]  These are two distinct species that have become intertwined both in their cultivation and in their cultural uses throughout the region. To uncover the value of the ‘betel-nut’ thus involves exploring both *Areca catechu* which produces the areca nut and *Piper betle* L. which produces the betel leaf, which have been adopted for many uses, including as medicines, dyes, adhesives, and culinary ingredients.[^3] Amongst these vast applications, perhaps the species’ most notable mark in Singapore and Southeast Asia has been in the widespread practice of betel-nut chewing.[^4] The English name for the practice ‘betel-nut chewing’ (hereafter ‘betel chewing’ to refer to the practice and ‘betel-nut’ when referring to the areca nut and betel leaf together) perpetuates the misnomer of the two species’ relationship as it is the areca nut – wrapped inside the betel leaf – that is chewed, typically alongside other ingredients.[^5] As a rich multicultural regional tradition, the scope of betel chewing’s impact surpasses the act itself and is an apt reflection of Singapore’s multicultural history.

## Chewing the Betel-Nut Quid
The simplest form of betel chewing requires three ingredients: the areca nut, a betel leaf, and <span eid="Q250423">lime</span>.[^6]  The areca nut is sliced or cut and shaved and wrapped into the leaf which is topped with slaked lime flakes or lime paste.[^7] The betel quid is then chewed as the tongue presses between the teeth and cheek where the quid is located.[^8] In Indian communities, additional spices such as cardamon, cloves, and nutmeg are often added to the basic betel quid to make *pan/paan*.[^9] The addition of chewing tobacco and <span eid="Q19840126">gambier</span> were also popular complements to the betel quid in different communities within Singapore and Malaya.[^10]

## Uncertain Origins and Arrival in Singapore
While betel chewing has over time proliferated across Asia and the Pacific Islands, there is uncertainty regarding the origins of the practice.[^11]  More recent linguistic and archaeological evidence has suggested that the practice is likely indigenous to the Indonesian archipelago, with the earliest archaeological evidence of the species in <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="19.567806, 98.281083, 11">Spirit Cave</span> in north-western Thailand in 10,000 BC and betel-stained teeth found in <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="10, 118.83, 11">Duyong Cave</span> in the southern Philippines documented to 3000 BC.[^12] The earliest archaeological evidence for the emergence of the practice in Singapore points to the 1300s, where traces of lime were found in containers that may have been used to prepare the betel-nut quid.[^13] According to botanist <span eid="Q4084920">Isaac Burkill</span>, the palm is “undoubtedly Malaysian in origin, but [it is] impossible to find any restricted part of Malaysia as its home.”[^14] This ambiguity regarding the roots of the plant, the practice, and its arrival in Singapore highlights the convergence of cultures on a similar practice of chewing that blurs the distinction between where the practice originated, how it evolved, and how it was subsequently influenced.

## Literary History Highlighting Cultural Traditions
The practice of betel chewing precedes modern history, with mentions in literary traditions spanning cultures. Notably, betel chewing is mentioned in multiple passages in the <span eid="Q5254550">Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals)</span> where it belonged to the aristocratic realm as a symbol of status and pleasure.[^15] However, by the 1800s in Singapore, betel chewing was a widespread practice among Indian, Malay, and Peranakan communities, with an [1827 newspaper article](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singchronicle18280313-1.2.6?oref=article-citation) commenting that the “very spirited demand” had evolved into the practice becoming “quite a drug” in reference to its stimulant and addictive properties.[^16] By the 1950s, arguably at the height of the practice’s prevalence in Singapore, there was wide consensus that betel nuts were [far from a luxury good](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19530714-1.2.78?oref=article-citation) and instead an integral part of daily life that transcended class boundaries.[^17]

The spread in the practice is attached to the high cultural and symbolic value associated with both betel chewing and the betel leaf. In the Sri Rama (Malay derivation of the <span eid="Q37293">Ramayana</span>, betel chewing is a gesture of <span data-click-image-zoomto="1|98,1751,2220,1760">welcoming and invitation</span>[^18] This is paired with expressions of humility about the quality of the nut as an additional token of Malay politeness.[^19] The Sri Rama also highlights the physical effects of betel chewing, notably its <span data-click-image-zoomto="2|402,2070,1823,1445">“stupefying effect”</span> which underscores the chemical properties tied to its medicinal value.[^20]

In the Malay story of [Raja Donan](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/41735395), betel chewing is integral to betrothal procedures as a sign of devotion.[^21] Indeed, alongside the nut itself which is presented to guests during special occasions, the betel container *kotak sirih/sireh*, which holds the betel quid ingredients in different compartments, was often gifted in proposal or wedding ceremonies.[^22] Overall, both the betel quid as well as the betel leaf itself came with high symbolic social value and were regarded as tokens of friendliness, agreement, invitation, and even as a formal apology in Malay communities.[^23]

Betel chewing is similarly significant in Indian cultural and literary traditions. While *pan* originally referred to the betel leaf, it evolved to denote both the areca nut and betel leaf.[^24] The <span eid="Q606278">*Hitopadesha*</span>, (directly translated as good or friendly advice) is a compilation of Sanskrit fables drawing on *niti* or the principles of morality to advise on proper conduct.[^25] In the [story of the faithful Rajpoot](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/hitopadesha_arnold/3_war.html#07_faithful_rajpoot), thirteen ‘virtues’ of the areca nut are given, capturing <span data-click-image-zoomto="1047,101,874,836">attributes</span> like it being sweet, salty, bitter, and astringent, practical and <span data-click-image-zoomto="1,70,907,869">medicinal properties</span> such as aiding in digestion, and <span data-click-image-zoomto="492,302,811,777">uses of social value</span> like acting as a mouth freshener and aphrodisiac.[^26]

As <span eid="Q6712641">M.H. Marigowda</span> emphasises, “to attempt to write about the ceremonial uses of betel nut and betel leaves in India… may be likened to an attempt to write the cultural history of the people of India in one sentence.”[^27] This is extended further when considering other cultures’ different, though often overlapping, valuation and usage of the betel nut.

## Entangled Tangible and Symbolic Cultural Value: Masticatory and Medicinal
Both the areca nut and betel leaf have had a history of medical applications in Indian and Malay traditions. The areca nut contains ingredients including tannin and active alkaloids including arecaidine and <span eid="Q423515">arecoline</span>, the latter of which has toxic properties.[^28] Aside from acting as a mouth freshener which is a crucial custom in India, burned nuts are also effective for cleaning teeth.[^29] This juxtaposes the common imagery of black stained teeth and red spittle associated with betel chewing which are not inevitable to the practice.[^30] Further, the juice of tender areca nuts is reportedly an effective laxative.[^31] In veterinary medicine, powdered areca nuts are used as an anthelmintic to eradicate tapeworms.[^32] The betel leaf also contains essential oils that are used to treat various afflictions like throat inflammation, and oil can also be added to the leaf and directly applied as a dressing to sores.[^33] Betel chewing is also viewed as a digestive aid that strengthens the stomach and a preventative measure against bowel problems like dysentery.[^34]

       description="The sireh container is commonly used to store betel leaves used for chewing and other purposes."> 
       
The areca nut is also a common ingredient in traditional Malayan medicine and crosses into the spiritual realm. For example, one medicinal manual from 1923 recorded that the betel can be chewed alongside the root of *Massoia aromatica* while repeating prayers that aim to keep the devil and illness away.[^35] Additionally, given the entangled cultural significance of the areca nut being a positive symbol that is often given and received, the refusal to receive an areca nut is viewed as symptom of illnesses attributed to evil spirits like a <span eid="Q7161327">*pelesit*</span>.[^36] Within the realm of divination, the spittle produced by chewing betel is used in “water-gazing” which enables a Malay wizard (<span eid="Q7403604">*pawang*</span>*, bomor*) to make diagnoses.[^37] Aside from the nut, young shoots of the areca palm were used by Malay women to induce abortions during early pregnancy.[^38]

## Economic Cultivation
Given such expansive uses that led to the both the betel leaf and areca nut being incorporated into everyday life, areca palm plantations were cultivated in Singapore, and plantations often interplanted the betel vine with the areca palm.[^39] However, while the areca palm is relatively easy to cultivate, the betel vine requires significant expert knowledge for successful growth to ensure proper propagation techniques and maintaining optimal conditions.[^40] Cultivation of both species thus relied on native expertise and were for local consumption as well as for exportation to countries like India where demand exceeded local production.[^41] The decline in areca and betel plantations corresponded with the rise in the rubber industry, with a reduction of 3,935 acres dedicated to areca palm plantations between 1910 and 1918 while prices for areca nuts followed an inverse upward trend from $3 per pikul (approximately 60kg) to $4-$6 per pikul.[^42]

A variety of methods to prepare raw nuts also highlights the different uses of the areca nut and follows a similar trend across India and Malaya.[^43] Some of the main kinds of prepared nuts include whole dried nuts (*unde-adike, pinang kossi*), split or cut nuts of different variations (*battalu adike, churu-adike, lavanga-churu, pinang blah*), smoked nuts (*pinang salai*), and salted nuts (*pinang asin*).[^44]

## Decline of Betel Chewing in Singapore
While betel chewing was accepted, practiced, and valued by Asian communities in Singapore throughout the 19th and 20th century, the European community generally viewed betel chewing with disdain and prejudice.[^45] They associated betel chewing with tobacco chewing which was tied to lower classes of society.[^46] Moreover, the visceral impact of stained red lips and blackened teeth associated with daily chewing were deemed “vulgar” and “foul”.[^47]

Although betel chewing was first linked to oral cancer in the early 1900s and connections were increasingly made throughout the 1930s, it was not until the 1950s and 60s when sustained attention was drawn to it with newspapers frequently printing quotes from doctors stating carcinogenic links, discouraging the practice.[^48] Further, tied to broader trends of Singapore’s urbanisation and modernisation, increased attention was placed on urban hygiene.[^49] Betel chewing generates excess red spittle, and public spitting became a public health challenge that was stigmatised throughout the 1930s and 1940s.[^50] The government eventually banned spitting in public places and betel chewing declined in popularity among the younger generation until the practice became increasingly uncommon in Singapore by the 1980s.[^51]

## A Sustained Memory
Betel chewing is nowadays largely survived on in Singapore only by Indian, Bangladeshi, and Burmese migrants and tourists and among cultural heritage trails memorialising the impact of betel-nut trade.[^52] However, betel chewing’s popularity remains high across parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.[^53] As such, it remains a public health concern due to its addictive and carcinogenic properties.[^54] This also speaks to the interacting factors that culminated in the height of the practice’s popularity – from physical addiction to cultural attachment, the story of betel chewing is complex and spans cultural boundaries. Betel chewing has been valued and devalued according to different narratives and is just one aspect of a broader story on the uses and impacts of the intertwined areca palm and betel leaf both in Singapore and the region.
